 * It re-exports `@philosoph/module-api` because those contract types (Content, QuestionInstance,
 * RevealInfo and friends) travel over the same wire. It deliberately does **not** export any
 * question module: the engine composes those from whatever module packages are installed
 * (discovered by `yarn modules:sync`), so nothing in the core depends on which modules exist.
